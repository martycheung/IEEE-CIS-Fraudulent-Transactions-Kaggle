Non-US transactions have an exchange rate applied, so are not exact, have a number of extra dp's. This is potentially already marked in ProductCD as C.\n- TrasactionDT: timedelta from a given reference datetime (not an actual timestamp). TransactionDT first value is 86400, which corresponds to the number of seconds in a day (60 * 60 * 24 = 86400) so I think the unit is seconds. Using this, we know the data spans 6 months, as the maximum value is 15811131, which would correspond to day 183. *Might be good to split train/validation sets by time, since train/test is split by time\n- dist: distances between (not limited) billing address, mailing address, zip code, IP address, phone area, etc.\n- C1-C14: counting, such as how many addresses are found to be associated with the payment card, etc.\n- Vxxx: Vesta engineered rich features, including ranking, counting, and other entity relations.\n- D1-D15: timedelta, such as days between previous transaction, etc.\n\nThe TransactionDT feature is a timedelta from a given reference datetime (not an actual timestamp, but we can potentially still use this to build time dependent features)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Definition of Fraud\nBelow is the definition of fraud by one of the Vesta team organisers:\n\"The logic of our labeling is define reported chargeback on the card as fraud transaction (isFraud=1) and transactions posterior to it with either user account, email address or billing address directly linked to these attributes as fraud too. If none of above is reported and found beyond 120 days, then we define as legit transaction (isFraud=0).\nHowever, in real world fraudulent activity might not be reported, e.g. cardholder was unaware, or forgot to report in time and beyond the claim period, etc. In such cases, supposed fraud might be labeled as legit, but we never could know of them.
