# IEEE-CIS-Fraudulent-Transactions-Kaggle
Kaggle competition about predicting fraudulent card transactions. Below is the plan:

1. Basic data preparation and memory minimisation
2. Exploratory data anlsysis
3. Baseline model using Xgboost (no feature engineering)
4. Baseline model using Xgboost and Cross Validation (no feature engineering)
2. Feature Engineering and test features for any performance uplift
3. Test other GBM variants - Xgboost vs LightGBM vs Catboost
4. Ensemble Modelling
